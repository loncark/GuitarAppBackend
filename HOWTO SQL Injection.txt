1. Deploy the app to Openshift (or Docker?)
It does not work on localhost bc %20 gets substituted
for spaces in the request.

2. Send a GET request on this address:
https://guitar-app-guitarapp.apps.na410r.prod.ole.redhat.com/1231;delete from guitar

3. The item is now deleted and getByCode returns 404
when you search for code 1231.
