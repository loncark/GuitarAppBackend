Started with a HelloWorld Spring Boot app on 30.5.2023.

Creation of classes progression:
- GuitarController -> Guitar, Material -> GuitarRepository
-> schema.sql, data.sql -> GuitarDTO -> GuitarService

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the JPA (Java Persistence API) works:
1. Mark the class you want to be the row of a table with @Entity
2. In that class, mark an id with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
3. If no table name is specified, JPA assumes that the table name is equal to the class name
4. The entity class has to have a default empty constructor
5. Create a ClassRepository interface that extends JpaRepository
6. Call the methods provided by default

ChatGPT says this: Here are the commonly used methods available by default [just by extending the JpaRepository]:

-> findAll(): Retrieves all entities of the specified type.
-> findById(ID id): Retrieves an entity by its ID.
-> save(S entity): Saves an entity (inserts or updates) and returns the saved entity.
-> deleteById(ID id): Deletes an entity by its ID.
-> count(): Returns the count of entities.
-> existsById(ID id): Checks if an entity with the given ID exists.
-> findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids): Retrieves a list of entities by their IDs.


CONFIGURING THE H2 DATABASE
1. Create schema.sql and data.sql files in the resources folder
2. Update the application.properties with
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb		//default!
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
3. The database console can be accessed on localhost:your-app-port/h2-console (default is 8080, can be changed in application.properties)
4. The default address needs to be pasted into the console to access it

*** DO NOT PUT IDS IN DATA.SQL WHEN WORKING WITH JPA ***

---------------------------------------------------------------------

- wrote GET and DELETE methods and tests
- wrote POST and PUT methods and tests

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Created a JavaFx client that consumes all the endpoints:

- wrote the GuitarAppClient in the same way we did in the labs
- prepared the scene using SceneBuilder
- added adequate id's to elements, specified onClick methods for buttons and the controller
- SAVED EVERY TIME I MADE A CHANGE
- added and modified the Alerts class to have some input sanitization
- gave up on tests for it because the dependencies were impossible to configure

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Created a MuleSoft Flow that consumes the endpoints and publishes messages to ActiveMQ:

- Mule app listens on port 7001
- saves the request into a variable and writes it down into a txt file
- the request gets sent to the server where it is processed
- the response is appended to the same txt file and sent back to the client
- additionally, the whole file gets read and its contents are published to the queue
- for ActiveMQ intructions, refer to the specific capitalized txt file

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Created a jBPM process that consumes two endpoints of the GuitarApp:

- ran the jBPM container and accessed the console on localhost:8080/business-central with wbadmin/wbadmin credentials
- created an new project within the existing space and a new business process inside the project
- dnd all the components, specify their nature (human task, script...), decide on branching conditions, specify process data and assign it properly
- add a work item handler by going to project Settings -> Deployments -> Work Item Handlers, add 'Rest' as a name and 'new org.jbpm.process.workitem.rest.RESTWorkItemHandler()' as a value
- build and deploy the process
- start the GuitarApp server
- go to Menu -> Process instances -> New Instance -> GuitarAppProcess, enter nothing, just Submit
- go to Menu -> Tasks, click on the latest task and complete it
- if the process finishes correctly, you should be able to find the output in the server.log file (located at standalone/log folder)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Created a NIIS branch whose pom.xml, application.properties and Controller are altered to send a message on POST, PUT and DELETE to the message queue using JMS template.

Done.
