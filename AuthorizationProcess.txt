0. Add
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
to pom.xml.

1. Create a SecurityConfigurer class and in it a userDetailsService()
that maps users to roles using a password encoder.
2. Add a SecurityFilterChain to determine which requests should
require authorization before continuation.

3. Add @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('ROLE_ADMIN')") annotation to
endpoints in the controller to determine who can access which
endpoint

This should now work.

4. To use a database instead of manual mapping of the roles to
users, create a UserInfo class and use lombok to autogenerate
constructors, getters and setters (@Data).
5. Create a UserInfoRepository.
6. Make the userDetailsService() return a UserInfoUserDetailsService.

7. Create the UserInfoDetailsService class which is an
implementation of UserDetailsService and inject the
UserInfoRepository inside it. The loadUserByUsername() method
which needs to be implemented will retrieve a UserInfo object and
it needs to be converted to the UserDetails return type. That's
why we create a UserInfoUserDetails class that implements UserDetails.

8. Create a UserInfoUserDetails class that mirrors UserInfo
and implement all the methods. Make loadUserByUsername return
the UserInfo object mapped to UserDetails.

9. Update the schema.sql and optionally data.sql.

10. Create a new AuthService to hold a addUser() function.
11. Create a new AuthController with an addNewUser endpoint.
12. Add a AuthenticationProvider to SecurityConfigurer (no
particular usage, Spring Boot doesn't work without it).

This should now work.
