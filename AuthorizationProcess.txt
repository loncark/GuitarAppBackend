0. Add
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
to pom.xml.

1. Create a SecurityConfigurer class and in it a userDetailsService()
that maps users to roles using a password encoder.
2. Add a SecurityFilterChain to determine points of authentication.

3. Add @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('ROLE_ADMIN')") annotation to
endpoints in the controller to determine points of authorization.

This should now work.

4. To use a database instead of manual mapping of the roles to
users, create a UserInfo class and use lombok to autogenerate
constructors, getters and setters (@Data).
5. Create a UserInfoRepository.
6. Make the userDetailsService() return a UserInfoUserDetailsService.

7. Create the UserInfoDetailsService class which is an
implementation of UserDetailsService and inject the
UserInfoRepository inside it. The loadUserByUsername() method
which needs to be implemented will retrieve a UserInfo object and
it needs to be converted to the UserDetails return type. That's
why we create a UserInfoUserDetails class that implements UserDetails.

8. Create a UserInfoUserDetails class that mirrors UserInfo
and implement all the methods. Make loadUserByUsername return
the UserInfo object mapped to UserDetails.

9. Update the schema.sql and optionally data.sql.

10. Create a new AuthService to hold a addUser() function.
11. Create a new AuthController with an addNewUser endpoint.
12. Add a AuthenticationProvider to SecurityConfigurer (no
particular usage, Spring Boot doesn't work without it).
13. Add a WebSecurityCustomizer to enable all access
to h2-console.

This should now work. To log in, add a name and a password
under 'Authorization' field in Rester. If the client returns
html instead of json, add .httpBasic() to SecutiryConfig.

JWT IMPLEMENTATION

14. Write a authenticateAndReturnToken() function and create
a AuthRequest DTO class that is its argument.

15. Write a JwtService that generates tokens according to
the JWT rules.

Now JWT is generated for each person, we want to create it
only for the successfully authenticated one.

16. Add authentication lines to authenticateAndReturnToken()
and define an AuthenticationManager bean in the Config.
17. Write extractClaim() and validateToken() methods in the
JwtService that decode and check for token validity.
18. Write a JwtFilter middleware class that implements
OncePerRequestFilter interface and calls the validation
methods above. Add it to the SecurityConfig FilterChain
alongside the sessionManagement, remove the formLogin.

Now JWT is implemented. This is how to use it: first send a
POST request to /auth/token with a username and a password in
the body. You will receive a valid token if they match the data
in the database, otherwise you get 401 Unathorized response.

Suppose the user you have just validated has the admin role. Now
go to the ordinary server request that is admin-accessible and
alongside the necessary data put an Authorization field in the
header. Make its value "Bearer " plus paste the JWT token. Send it
and the server will respond affirmatively.
