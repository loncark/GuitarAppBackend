To package your Spring Boot application into a JAR file using IntelliJ IDEA, you can follow these steps:

    Open your Spring Boot project in IntelliJ IDEA.

    Make sure your project is configured as a Maven project.
    If it is not already configured, you can right-click on the project folder in the Project Explorer,
    select "Add Framework Support," and choose Maven.

    Ensure that your Spring Boot application has a proper Maven configuration file named pom.xml.
    This file should be located in the root directory of your project. If you don't have a pom.xml file,
    you can create one using the Spring Initializr or by manually creating a Maven project.

    Build the project by selecting "Build" -> "Build Project" from the top menu or using the shortcut keys
    (e.g., Ctrl + F9 on Windows/Linux or Command + F9 on macOS). This step ensures that all dependencies are
    downloaded and the project is compiled successfully.

    After the build process completes, open the Maven Projects tool window by selecting
    "View" -> "Tool Windows" -> "Maven Projects" from the top menu.

    In the Maven Projects tool window, expand your project and navigate to the "Lifecycle" section.

    Double-click on the "package" lifecycle phase. This will execute the Maven package goal, which creates a
    JAR file containing your Spring Boot application.

    Wait for the Maven build process to complete. You can monitor the build progress in the "Run" tool
    window at the bottom of IntelliJ IDEA.

    Once the build is successful, the generated JAR file can be found in the target directory of your project.
    The JAR file will have a name that matches your project's artifact ID and version, such as myproject-1.0.0.jar.

Congratulations! You have successfully packaged your Spring Boot application into a JAR file using IntelliJ IDEA.
You can now distribute and run the JAR file on any environment with a compatible Java runtime.
